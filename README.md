My Learning Hub

Welcome to my personal repository! Here, I share my journey through a variety of interests, including guitar techniques, SQL, and other learning adventures. This repository is a collection of notes, exercises, and projects that I've been working on. It’s a space where I upload everything I’m learning and experimenting with. Feel free to explore, learn, and even contribute if you’d like. Dive in and join me on this exciting path of discovery!
