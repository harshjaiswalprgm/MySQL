To view a specific attribute (or column) of a table in MySQL, you can use the SELECT statement. Here's the general syntax:

# select Student_Id, Address from student;

When using the `SELECT` statement with various operators in the `WHERE` clause, you can refine your queries to extract specific data based on conditions. Here are some examples with different operators:

### 1. **Equality and Inequality Operators**

- **Equality (`=`)**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, department
  FROM employees
  WHERE department = 'Sales';
  ```

- **Inequality (`<>` or `!=`)**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, department
  FROM employees
  WHERE department <> 'Sales';
  -- or
  SELECT name, department
  FROM employees
  WHERE department != 'Sales';
  ```

### 2. **Comparison Operators**

- **Greater Than (`>`)**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, salary
  FROM employees
  WHERE salary > 50000;
  ```

- **Less Than (`<`)**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, salary
  FROM employees
  WHERE salary < 50000;
  ```

- **Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, salary
  FROM employees
  WHERE salary >= 50000;
  ```

- **Less Than or Equal To (`<=`)**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, salary
  FROM employees
  WHERE salary <= 50000;
  ```

### 3. **Logical Operators**

- **AND**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, department, salary
  FROM employees
  WHERE department = 'Sales' AND salary > 50000;
  ```

- **OR**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, department, salary
  FROM employees
  WHERE department = 'Sales' OR salary > 50000;
  ```

- **NOT**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, department, salary
  FROM employees
  WHERE NOT department = 'Sales';
  ```

### 4. **Pattern Matching Operator**

- **LIKE**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name
  FROM employees
  WHERE name LIKE 'J%';
  ```

### 5. **Range Operator**

- **BETWEEN**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, salary
  FROM employees
  WHERE salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 60000;
  ```

### 6. **Set Membership Operators**

- **IN**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name
  FROM employees
  WHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing');
  ```

- **NOT IN**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name
  FROM employees
  WHERE department NOT IN ('Sales', 'Marketing');
  ```

### 7. **Null Check Operator**

- **IS NULL**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name
  FROM employees
  WHERE department IS NULL;
  ```

- **IS NOT NULL**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name
  FROM employees
  WHERE department IS NOT NULL;
  ```

These examples cover the most commonly used operators in the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` statement in MySQL. You can combine these operators to create complex queries that precisely match your data requirements.
